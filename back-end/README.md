# Back End:

This project was generated using Node.Js 

Dealing with students, teachers and courses.

We used a postgreSQL database which is one of the most used database for websites. 
We created a school database with 3 tables.

The BackEnd is sending data to service and students/teachers/courses component in the FrontEnd

We also tried to implement a middleware and a login page, but it is really difficult to link it to the angular front end so for now it's not working.

## Launching it

You can launch the back end with the command :
```bash
npm start
```
